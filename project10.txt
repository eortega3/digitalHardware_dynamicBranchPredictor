3. Project Overview: 	In this project we simulated a dynamic branch buffer.
			To do this we had to create the logic of our psuedo cache
			that held, besed on PC value of whether we were taking or 
			not taking the branches then based on past treads, predicted 
			the stage in which what would occur.  

4. Testing Summary:	We ran into alot of false positives because our logic 
			originally or our switch case statement for our next state 
			logic had a singular default when in actuality we should have 
			had two defaults pending if it was not a hit.  Due to this, we 
			did not know how to instiate the logic.  After goign to Sat we 
			were ale to figure outthe logc for it and get our first 6 tests
			run positie with no  false positves.   

5. Test Vector Explanations:  	We wrote to a different entry in the buffer and had it go
				all the way up to 2'b11.  then from here we tried to go 
				one ever but we could not due to our logical protection 
				from this happening. Then from here we overwrote the 1st 
				entry of the buffer several times with dfferent braches.
